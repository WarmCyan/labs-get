x don't throw error when try to create a folder that already exists 

x setup needs to not recheck the path variables once they're set! (Also find way to check if setup has admin privileges and not run if it doesn't have it?
- EVERYTHING that MIGHT vary needs to be put inside of something that can be changed in the data folder!!! 
- Config files need to allow for changes/different scripts

- Add tags listing option to linux labs-get
- Alphabatize listings
- Fix setup?
x Make sure when default-tags set, doesn't add extra space at end (windows)
- Problem with linux setup not properly assigning data dir?
- Make linux setup executable (and something doesn't work when run as sudo????)
- NOTE THAT LINUX SETUP ONLY WORKS IF YOU USE SOURCE COMMAND
- For setups, add executable command (can make config setups easier, auto runs a setup script to make the hardlink)
- Dash override isn't working on linux?
