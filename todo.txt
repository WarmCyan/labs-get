- Add tags listing option to linux labs-get
- Alphabatize listings
- Fix setup?
- Make sure when default-tags set, doesn't add extra space at end (windows)
- Problem with linux setup not properly assigning data dir?
- Make linux setup executable (and something doesn't work when run as sudo????)
- NOTE THAT LINUX SETUP ONLY WORKS IF YOU USE SOURCE COMMAND
- For setups, add executable command (can make config setups easier, auto runs a setup script to make the hardlink)
