setup:

- set execution policy to be remote-signed
- check env variables, if not found, set accordingly (after prompting user for paths) note that on linux this means it adds to end of the .bashrc file
- copy the labs-get file over to the bin
- prompt for url to git repo that contains a list.dat file
- clones that git repo into the pkg folder (named as labs-get-list [which is what it should be anyway])
- create data folder for labs-get
- create installed.dat
- prompt user for default tags
- create default-tags.dat
